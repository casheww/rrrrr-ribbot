# The RRRRR's Ribbot
Botched code for the Really Riotous Rambunctious Robot Radicals' Ribbot - a small robot that can fit in the average Tupperware box and can't drive in a straight line. Mild frog theming, horrible code, and loose motor connections

TODO - Programming
- advanced motor control
- *course logic*

TODO - Extra
- frorg theming!!
- probably some other important stuff that I can't remember
